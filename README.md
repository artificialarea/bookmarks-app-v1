Exercise per: https://courses.thinkful.com/react-v1/checkpoint/13#forms

Repo src: https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/bookmarks-react-client/ (note: multiple branches) ... which for some reason I neglected to fork, instead recreating 'static version' branch from scratch and proceeding from there.

## Static version
In the static version of the app the components are built without any user interaction or state.

## With State
Contains a basic state passed as props around the app. No interactivity.

## With interactivity
Event handlers are added to components and callbacks are passed via props to the components that need them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
